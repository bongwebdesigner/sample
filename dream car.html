   Today, we announce the highest annual sales results in our 117-year history.<br> 
   We delivered 5,586 motor cars to clients around the world, an increase of 49% on last year’s total.<br> 
   We saw extremely strong demand for all Rolls-Royce models, led by #Phantom, our pinnacle product.<br> 
   Growth was driven principally by our new #Ghost in its first full year of availability, boosted further by the launch of the new #BlackBadge Ghost in October.  <br>
   This, together with continuing strong demand for our super-luxury SUV, #Cullinan, has filled our order books well into the third quarter of 2022. <br> 
   Our Provenance (pre-owned) programme also enjoyed exceptional sales results in 2021, achieving an all-time record.<br>

   No other manufacturer sells more cars in the +€250k segment than Rolls-Royce.
